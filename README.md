## About
This project was created purely for entertainment and enjoyment, inspired by Saming's popular game 2048, which is a clone of [1024](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328011720/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024). 

2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created.
